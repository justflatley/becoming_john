<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Hardin, MT -&gt; Sturgis, SD (330 Miles)</a></p>
<p>Despite the strong winds and hail that pelted my tent all night, I was able to get a pretty good nights sleep. My first stop before heading to Sturgis was Little Bighorn Battlefield. I had only set aside 30 minutes to walk around and see the monument, but I wish I had side aside half of the day. I had to skip the informational video, museum and ranger talks, which all sounded really interesting.<span id="more-816"></span></p>
<p>While heading up to Last stand hill there are makers that tell the story leading up to the Custer&#8217;s last stand. Along the way there are markers for exactly where soldiers and warriors had died. Since I had arrived right when the park opened, I was the only one at the top of the hill where there is a memorial for Custer and his army. It was surreal feeling looking around the open plains and seeing grave markers scattered around. I felt like I could really imagine what it looked like at the end of the battle. <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-821" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P8060007-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p>I was pressed for time but I took the winding road out to the actual Little Bighorn Battlefield monument at the Reno-Benten Battlefield site. Along the way you can see isolated grave stones that help paint a picture of the battle.</p>

<p>I had gotten tired of riding on interstates and opted to take a state road to Devil&#8217;s Tower where I would be meeting my old roommate Ben. Up until this point there were only a few songs that I had stuck in my head. Don&#8217;t ask why, but the predominate one was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCLY0Rlx6Q">Shut Up and Dance</a>. Now that I was riding onÂ open roads with Harley&#8217;s passing me every few minutes and amber rolling hills I couldn&#8217;t help but hear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm5DPlNCmtk">Born to be Wild</a> in the back of my head.</p>
<p>I was only about an hour away from Devil&#8217;s tower before I needed to stop for gas. I could tell I was getting closer to Sturgis considering the gas station was packed with motorcyclists. It ended up taking me 30 minutes to grab fuel.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-837 size-large" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296-e1441052877461-1024x616.jpg" alt="Snapchat-6757153180783262296" width="629" height="378" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296-e1441052877461-1024x616.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296-e1441052877461-300x181.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296-e1441052877461-900x542.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Snapchat-6757153180783262296-e1441052877461.jpg 1196w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>After riding for a bit on a local state road I popped out onto HWY 24 and found myself in the middle of a 50 motorcycle pack. If you&#8217;ve ever watched Arrested Development, it felt like a Tobias moment. There is something to be said for strength in numbers, but being around so many motorcyclist in a close proximity got me a little nervous. To make matters worse, when I got to the KOA to meet with Ben it was like a zoo. There were motorcycles parked everywhere.</p>
<p>Ben, his dad, and I grabbed a quick lunch and headed up to Devil&#8217;s Tower. In the distance it looks like a steep mountain, but once you get closer you can see that it looks like it&#8217;s build of stone columns. Ben read in the gift store that scientist believe the tower is an extinct volcano and that as the magma cooled and cracked it created the columns.</p>

<p>Getting gas didn&#8217;t get any easier to closer we got to Sturgis. The Conoco we stopped at must have had over 100 motorcyclist and it took us almost an hour to get fuel.</p>

<p>Riding through Sturgis is a lesson in clutch management, sharing lanes, and parking in tight spaces.Â Generally, theÂ attendance is around 500,000 people, but because this was the 75th anniversary they estimated that 1 million people passed through Sturgis throughout the week. Sturgis itself has a population of roughly 7,000 people.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-829" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150806_172358494" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150806_172358494-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>The best way I can describe the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is it&#8217;s like a state fairÂ full of debauchery andÂ middle age white men with an average BMI of 35 who ride Harley&#8217;s that they brought in on a trailer. If you&#8217;re a small guy like Ben, good luck finding a shirt smaller than an XL. Also, these guys treat their pins and patches like they&#8217;re beanie babies except they are worth nothing. Some of the patches say something along the lines of &#8220;I Rode Mine Sturgis&#8221; even though most of these guys brought their bikes on a trailer. I saw everything from trucks with motorcycles in the bedÂ to a truck pulling a RV pulling a motorcycle trailer.</p>

<p>Most of the bars you&#8217;ll see at Sturgis are way too overbuilt for a city of 7,000 people that has one major rally that lasts three weeks. They look like outdoor concert venues and have hip performances from the likes of Alice Cooper and Bret Michaels. I really wonder what will happen when this generation passes away and my generation fills in. What bands/artist could I expect to see at Sturgis in 30 years, if the Rally is still going on. My hope is for Kanye West.</p>
<p>As for the debauchery aspect of Sturgis, the list is almost limitless but here are some of the things I experienced:</p>
<p><strong>Women wearing pasties and body paint with their husbands (?) showing them off.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Custom bikes complete with hydraulics that rival a cholo car.</strong></p>

<p>Despite feeling a bit like white trash, I had a hell of a time. However, Sturgis is a lot like Vegas. It&#8217;s fun to experience for a day or two, but anymore is way too much. Most people come in for one night and then spend the rest of the week going on all the awesome local rides through the Badlands and Black Hills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Missoula -&gt; Hardin (390 Miles)</a></p>
<p>My stay in Missoula was short lived as I needed to fly back to San Francisco for a job interview. I was bummed that I had missed my cousin Pete in Missoula because he was on tour with his blue grass band The Lil Smokies. Even worse, he told me they were going to be performing in San Francisco, but I would already be headed back to Montana. On Sunday I was looking at my Facebook stream and saw a post from the Lil Smokies page that they were going to be playing at Amnesia in the Mission the night before I was set to leave.<span id="more-812"></span></p>
<p>I had never gotten the chance to see Pete perform live and was excited to finally get the chance. Their band had just won the Telluride Blue Grass Festival battle of the bands and for good reason. Their music rocks and so does their stage presence.</p>

<p>I flew backÂ early on Tuesday and was planning to leave for West Yellowstone as soon as I landed. Unfortunately, my flight was delayed four hours and I had to make a difficult decision. My goal was to make it to Sturgis before the rally was over, but I was going to have to skip Yellowstone. I figured the parkÂ would always be there and opted to wait until the next day to leave. I could still ride through Bear Tooth Pass.</p>
<p>The next day I got up before the sun had risen and set out. It was freezing, but I had just bought some cold riding gear including new gloves. I was about half way to Butte when my bike started acting up. Every so often it felt like the engine wasn&#8217;t getting gas and the speedometer needle would drop. I could still see the odometer, so I figured it wasn&#8217;t a battery issue. After a few miles the issue started to become more frequent and I knew I needed to stop.</p>
<p>For most of this trip, anytime something bad or unfortunate has happened to me I&#8217;be wasÂ able to take it in stride. However, I had just gotten my bike serviced at the Harley dealer in Missoula and Â was pissed I was having issues less than 100 miles away. I took a look around my bike, checked for any loose connections, but nothing looked amiss.</p>
<p>I had two choices: continue on or turn around and head back to Missoula. Luckily, now that I was back in the states I was never farther than 50 miles from the nearest Harley Dealer. I decided to keep going, but I couldn&#8217;t follow the same route. I had been on an interstate all morning and knew IÂ couldn&#8217;t risk my bike acting up on a busy road. I opted to taking back roads all the way to Butte. A trip that should&#8217;ve taken me an hour ended up takingÂ three.</p>
<p>Luckily, Harley Davidson has an unspoken rule that they will prioritize a rider who is on the road over someone with an appointment. After a few hours of digging, they came and told me it was an issue with my battery connection. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. At Glacier National Park I had tightened the bolts with a socket wrench so there was no way they could&#8217;ve come loose. Turns out, the battery tender I had connected was causing a bad connection and we decided to toss it. I never used it anyway.</p>
<p>It was past noon by the time I got back on the road and I had to make another difficult decision. Do I try to ride Bear Tooth Pass and risk not making it to Sturgis. Again, I figured the ride will always be there and hit the interstate until I made it to Billings. I dunno why, but I had a hankering for a steak. I stopped by the Montana Chop House and had the best ribeye I&#8217;ve ever eaten. They must have tenderized the meat while the cow was still alive.</p>
<p>I had planned to stop for the night in Billings, but since I didn&#8217;t ride nearly as far as I expected, I decided to continue as far as I could so that my ride the next day wouldn&#8217;t be so long. I made it to Hardin before a blanket of black clouds caught up to me and set up my tent as fast as I could. As I was setting up a tent a bicyclist road into the campground who had been on the road for over a year. Our conversation didn&#8217;t last long because I received this emergency message on my phone:</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Weather Service in Billings has issued a Severe Thunderstorm <span class="il">Warning</span> for: Southeastern Yellowstone County in south central Montana. Northwestern Big Horn County in south central Montana</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much exactly where I was. Then I got this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 6:55 PM MDT, severe thunderstorms were located along a line extending from 9 miles northwest of Worden to 20 miles north of Fort Smith, moving northeast at 45 mph. Hazard, 65 mph wind gusts and Penny size hail. Source, radar indicated. These storms have a history of producing 60 to 70 mph winds. Impact: hail damage to vehicles is expected. Expect wind damage to roofs, siding and trees.</p></blockquote>
<p>The winds were so strong that I though my tent was going to be lifted off the ground with me in it. After a few scares, I ran out side and pounded my tent stakes as far into the ground as I could and listened as hail bounced off my bike. Luckily, no damage came of me or my gear and I was able to get a good nights sleep.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Hungry Horse, MT -&gt; Missoula, MT via Glacier National Park (381 miles)</a></p>
<p>I got up early to beat the crowd into Glacier National Park. News on the street was that the Going-To-The-Sun Road was going to be open all the way through the park and there was going to be a surge of people heading in. I got to the gate as the sun was rising and there was already a line of 20 cars. Unfortunately, the park ranger at the toll booth informed me that theÂ Going-To-The-Sun Road was still closed past Logan&#8217;s Pass. I was debating passing it up and heading to the other side of the park, but I figured I had enough time to do both.<span id="more-795"></span></p>
<p>The beginning of the ride was down a flat and winding road along Lake McDonald. The speed limit was a bit slow for my liking, but it was so cold that I couldn&#8217;t have driven muchÂ faster. Otherwise, my hands would&#8217;ve frozen.Â After I passed Lake McDonald, the road started to wind up the mountain side and the air got significantly cooler. The terrain made for one of best rides of the trip even though there was only small stone wall that prevented me from falling off the side of the mountain.</p>

<p>I had to stop a few times to warm my hands, but I wanted to stop anyway to take pictures of the view. It was a lot like Banff where I found myself wanting to take a picture every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>At one stop a couple asked me to take a photo for them. As I was handing their camera back they looked at my bike in amazement and asked &#8220;Where the hell have you been?!&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t washed my bike yet and it was still covered in dried mud. I told them nonchalantlyÂ about my trip up to Alaska and back down. They were astounded and couldn&#8217;t believe I had done it by myself. I had forgotten how impressive it was that I had survived that trip. I had met people along the way who had traveled farther than I had, but it was nice to shortly reflect on my accomplishment.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t had much expectations for Logan&#8217;s Pass considering I didn&#8217;t even know what to expect from the Going-To-The-Sun road. The views of the valley, along with Reynolds MountainÂ and Clements Mountain, were amazing. I found out at the ranger&#8217;s station that there was a short hike you could take to go see Hidden Lake, but I knew I didn&#8217;t have enough time if I wanted to make it to the other side of the park and get to Missoula before it was dark. I decided to pass up the hike and head back to the entrance to the park.<a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-802" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290034-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>As I headed back down I was glad that I had gotten into the park early. They had already closed the road to Logan&#8217;s Pass and there was a line of 50 cars waiting to get in. Chances are they wouldn&#8217;t have much luck since almost everyone I saw was going on the hike to Hidden Lake.</p>
<p>After a quick brunch at the entrance to the park I made my way across HWY 2 over to the east side of the park. My first stop was Two Medicine lake. From above, the lake has that beautiful turquoise color I had grown accustomed to seeing.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-799" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290061-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-801" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290051-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I continued along the road heading up towards St Mary&#8217;s. The roads started to wind tighter than any stretch I had been on yet. The speed limit never got higher than 30 MPH and often dipped to 15 MPH around hairpin turns. It made for an exciting ride, but I got too aggressive leaning into some turns and ended up scrapping the bottoms of my pipes. Nonetheless, the view the entire way was breathtaking. <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-798" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290059-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I never made it all the way down to St Mary&#8217;s Lake because I was running short on time. I made a stop at a look out point where I could see some of the fires plaguing the park. For the most part, it looked like everything was contained, so they must have kept the Going-To-The-Sun Road closed to clean up any debris. Â Funny enough I never would see a glacier on this day because most of them were farther North and I didn&#8217;t have time to travel that far.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-800" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7290054-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout the day, I noticed all the BMWs I had grown accustomed to seeingÂ were replaced with Harley cruisers. I definitely didn&#8217;t fit the cookie cutter mold of most of the riders on the road. First off, most people are bit riskier than I am and don&#8217;t wear a helmet. However, the average age is around 60, so I guess they&#8217;ve lived a long enough life they don&#8217;t care if they die in a minor collision. Other characteristics of the cookie cutter harley rider include a beer belly, white goatee, either a bald head or short white hair, and petite brunette who is 20 years younger riding on the back.</p>
<p>A lot of the day consisted of back tracking, which caused me to do ride more miles than I had wanted. As a result, I was anxious to get down to Missoula by the end of the day. I chose to take a more scenic route along Flathead Lake, but I would soon regret it. The ride was pretty, but the road was only one lane in each direction. It wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that everyone in Montana enjoys riding 5 mph under the speed limit. Then, when you have the opportunity to pass them, they decide to speed up and go 5 mph over the speed limit.</p>
<p>I had been fortunate on this trip to know someone in most major cities I was passing through. It afforded me the opportunity to see a familiar face and sleep under a solid roof. In Missoula, I had planned to stay with my cousin Pete, but he was on tour with his band The Lil Smokies. Luckily for me, his wife Erin was still in town and I was able to enjoy a few local brews and some homemade pizza after not seeing someone I knew for 8 days.</p>

<p class="p3">The weather report called for scattered thunderstorms all day around Banff and I still hadn&#8217;t gotten to see Lake Louise or Moraine Lake. I decided to book an Airbnb an hour and half south in Radium Hot Springs to hole up for the day and relax. I didnât bother visiting the hot springs because it just looked like a recreational pool and I wasnât too sore.<span id="more-780"></span></p>
<p class="p3">The next morning morning I woke up at 5am so I could backtrack an hour and half to Lake Louise to try to make it for sunrise, but the ride through the passage was frigid to say the least. It must have been 40Â°, because despite doubling down on my gloves and filling them with hand warmers, I still had to stop every 10 miles to warm up my hands.</p>
<p class="p3">The cold ride was worth it. I&#8217;ve honestly never see a lake more beautiful than Lake Louise. Itâs the combination of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, which reminds me of the Grand Budapest Hotel, the turquoise water color, the glacier, and the reflection of the mountains<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>that make it so beautiful.</p>

<p>However, within minutes of getting a picture fog started to roll in and I couldnât see more than a foot in front of me.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-785" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280157-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">I tried to wait out the fog in hops of grabbing a selfie, but it didnât seem like it was going to let up anytime soon so I rode 7 miles up a winding road to Moraine Lake. Like Lake Louise, itâs the color and surrounding mountains that make it so beautiful. I couldnât spend too long because I had to ride an hour and half back to my Airbnb to grab my gear and pack my bike before it was time to check out.</p>

<p class="p3">The ride from Radium Hot Springs to the Ride to the border wasnât too eventful. I mostly passed farmlands, but there were a few stretches where I rode along the top of a valley.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-789" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7280193-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">I had learned at earlier border crossings that it&#8217;s better to lie about being unemployed because it raises too many questions and makes me look suspicious. So when I reached the U.S. border the conversation went something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p4"><i>Border Patrol: &#8220;What do you do for work?&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Me: &#8220;I&#8217;m an entrepreneur.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Border Patrol: &#8220;What do you do as an entrepreneur?&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Me: &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of confidential, but basically I&#8217;m building a business to business mobile messaging app that helps them connect socially with their customers in a local setting.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Border Patrol: &lt;blank stare&gt;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p3">I think he on to my bluff because he proceeded to make me take everything off my bike and out of my saddlebags, which was a huge pain because it takes me about 15 &#8211; 20 minutes to pack my bike properly. Then he tried to slip me up about buying stuff in Canada or how much money I was carrying. He must&#8217;ve asked me 3 times if I bought any alcohol or tobacco. It must be my new mountain man beard that has taken away my innocent look.</p>
<p class="p3">Finally, he let me pass through and I could tell there was a long line behind me so I felt a bit rushed. Like before, I instinctively put my bike in gear and tried to start it. It died again. The patrol man gave me a push to try to kick start it, but the lights didn&#8217;t come on. I had to go into the building and wait 30 minutes for someone to come and jump my bike.</p>
<p class="p3">It&#8217;s at this point that I started to think that maybe there wasnât something wrong with the electrical system. After we took off my battery cover and touched only the positive lead of the cable to my battery my light turned on. I turned my bike on and was back on my way, but I was still confused how that worked. If I remembered correctly from high school science, you need both positive and negative leads to be attached for a current to pass through. It also helps when the jump kit is plugged in.</p>
<p class="p5">My plan was to camp just outside Glacier National Park so that I could wake up early and take my time riding through the park. I found a campsite just outside in Hungry Horse, but found out the famousÂ Going-to-the-Sun Road was closed half way up due to all the fires they had been having. They were hopeful that the road would open the next morning.</p>
<p class="p5">I hopped on my bike and tried to start my bike while it was in neutral, but I pulled in my clutch. My bike was dead again. At that point, I figured there was something wrong with my electrical system and it was tied to my clutch somehow. I went inside to see if lady behind the desk had any jumper cables, but she said Iâd have to wait for the owner to get back. I ended up carrying my bags up a hill to my campsite and set up my tent.</p>
<p class="p5">After a while of sitting at my campsite I saw a pick up truck roll up to the site across from mine. They also had a motorcycle parked out front that was covered so I decided to ask them if they had any cables. Unfortunately, they didnât but we started chatting about motorcycles. Turns out the guy, Lauren, who was obviously a harley owner with his big gut, white goatee and american flag bandana, was towing his bike around to go riding. He generally would ride with his wife, Jerry, but they wanted to camp and not have to worry about packing all their gear on their bike.</p>
<p class="p5">These people were awesome. They knew I was stuck and couldnât go out for food so they invited me over to their campsite for beer and dinner. We were talking about my adventures and all the kind people I had met. It was at that moment that I realized I had not only met a stranger at every location I had gone, but Iâd had a meaningful conversation with them as well. If you had asked me before this trip if I would strike up a conversation with a random stranger I wouldâve told you not in a million years.</p>
<p class="p5">We continued talking about motorcycles and I started talking about all the issues I had with my bike. I was planning on skipping Glacier National Park and heading straight for Missoula where I knew they had a Harley Dealer. Lauren told me that he did all of his own mechanical work and it really wasnât all that hard. He ordered the service manuals and they pretty much tell you step my step how to take apart and reassemble your bike. I had been reading <span class="s1">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</span> and thought it would be cool to learn to fix my own bike, especially after meeting those gearheads up in Fairbanks.</p>
<p class="p5">When I bought my Harley I figured it was a good brand/buildÂ and I would never need to worry about it breaking down. Obviously that hadnât been the case on this trip. I decided at that point that I could no longer rely on my motorcycle to just âwork.â After I got my bike serviced, I planned to buy the service manual and actually learn how to fix it or at minimum change the oil and air filter.</p>
<p class="p5">After a few beers, I went back down to the campsite office to wait for the owner. In the lounge area there was a TV that was showing an episode of <i>The Legend of Mick Dodge</i>. Iâm not really sure if you can call it divine intervention or coincidence, but it was the episode where a womanâs car breaks down and Mick helps her get back on the road by knocking the battery with a rock to break up acid build up on the terminals. I started to think that maybe thatâs the issue with my battery.</p>
<p class="p5">The owner walked in not long after, we took off the battery cover, and sure enough there was corrosion on the terminals that was causing a bad connection. We brushed off the corrosion with a metal brush, sprayed some WD-40 on it, and my bike fired right up. Iâm not surprised the terminals were corroded after all the vibrations, mud, and rain I rode through, but it made me wonder if my old battery was still good. It didnât matter in the end. I was just happy everything was working correctly on my bike and I would be able to ride through Glacier National Park the following day without worrying about my battery having any issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Dawson Creek -&gt; Lake Louise (469 miles)</a></p>
<p>Now that I was in a &#8220;major&#8221; town (read: they have a Walmart) I was going to make sure I wouldn&#8217;t be miserable riding the rest of the trip. I stopped by Walmart and grabbed some new rain gear that wasn&#8217;t breathable so I knew it would keep me dry. I also bought some hand warmers and a rubber mallet. The two motorcyclist that were camping next to me also had tents that need to be staked down and said that gravel campgrounds were no match for a rubber mallet.<span id="more-765"></span></p>
<p>This day&#8217;s ride was the one I had been looking forward to most because I would be riding through Jasper and Banff National Parks. Everyone I had talked to on the road said to make sure to leave plenty of time to ride the Icefields Parkway because I&#8217;d want to stop every few miles to take a picture.</p>
<p>The ride certainly did not disappoint. Just as I entered Jasper, the landscape changed drastically. I was now in the Rocky Mountain range and it was like nothing I&#8217;d see the whole trip. As the name suggests, all the mountains had rocky peaks and sparse tree coverage.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-774" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7260092-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>It was hard navigating the highway since most people were stopping along the highway to either take pictures of the scenery or look at the mountain goats. I had seen plenty of cool wildlife so I didn&#8217;t bother stopping.</p>
<p>For most of the day I had beautiful weather, but it was supposed to rain in Banff. Even though I was well prepared with new gear, I still didn&#8217;t want to get caught in bad weather. My first stop was atÂ Athabasca Falls where it seemed like everyone and their mother was at. My pictures don&#8217;t capture it, but it was a mad house walking around the walkways. I didn&#8217;t stay long because there were dark clouds all around me.</p>

<p>The rest of the trip I just stopped along the road if I saw something worth taking a picture of, which turned out to be about every 5 miles. The most amazing thing about Banff is the color of the water. It&#8217;s a beautiful turquoise color. Also, you frequently rideÂ along ridges, see glaciers, and travel in valleys with huge mountains surrounding you.</p>

<p>I spent half my day riding down the parkway and probably didn&#8217;t see even half of its beauty. There are so many hiking trails and stops you can make a long the way. I saw this trip as more of a scoping exercise to see what I&#8217;d want to do next time I came and visited the parks.</p>
<p>Halfway through my ride, I stopped for lunch at The Crossing to fill up on gas and grab some lunch. Since my battery died I had been conscious of only starting my bike in neutral, because it seemed like starting it in gear was what caused me trouble. There was a long line of RVs behind me and I felt rushed, so instinctively I put my bike in gear before I started it and sure and enough myÂ battery died again.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it. At this point I was fairly confident something was wrong with the electric system. I rolled it down a hill while sitting on it and my light turned back on, which meant I had enough juice to start my engine. Luckily, I avoided having to find someone to give me a jump start.</p>
<p>I had planned to camp at Lake Louise and reserved my spot the night before. I&#8217;m glad I did, because by the time I got to the campground it was completely full. Apparently, they haveÂ problems with bears because the entire campground isÂ surrounded by an electric fence.</p>

<p>I set up my tent as fast as I could, with help from my trusty rubber mallet, and put my food in the food shed. I wanted to ride up to Moraine Lake and Lake Louise because it was right at sunset and the lighting was perfect. Both lakes are rated as some of the most beautiful in the world. As I was walking back to my campsite I saw a huge fire explode in the corner of my eye. When I looked over there were people scrambling and it almost looked like the back of their van was on fire.</p>
<p>I ran up and found out their gas canister was too close to the fire, had caught ablaze, and spilled around their campsite. The fire looked like it was pretty well contained and the area was all dirt, but they were frantic and started pouring water on it. I started to scream at them to stop. They didn&#8217;t realize that gas is oil, oil and water don&#8217;t mix, and they were pretty much spreading the fire around their campsite. Other people came scrambling up and started pouring water on it and I had to grab the canisters out of their hands.</p>
<p>They were looking at me like I was crazy, but I had to explain to them simple chemistry. I told them to either smother it with a blanket or just let it burn out and make sure it didn&#8217;t spread. Once I felt confident they weren&#8217;t going to do anything stupid, I went back to my campsite to head up to the lakes. As I was leaving I could tell clouds had rolled in and I wasn&#8217;t going to get a decent picture.</p>
<p>I had brought a tripod on this trip expecting to use it for either selfies on the highway or some sweet night photos. I had completely forgotten that it didn&#8217;t get dark up north and I was too lazy to set it up during the day so I hadn&#8217;t gotten much use out of it. I was determined to finally use it and saw another guy set up along the river taking pictures of the full moon. This is the first picture I took with my tripod and the water almost looks like ice from the long exposure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After taking a few night photos I did some research on the next day&#8217;s weather. I wanted to make the trip up to Moraine Lake and Lake Louise for some photos, but the weather called for thunderstorms so I booked an Airbnb for the next day about and hour and half south before I called it a night.</p>

<p>It ended up raining all night again. When I woke up, I had to wait an hour for the rain to let up so I could pack my tent and head out for Dawson Creek. The forecast was cloudy skies and rain until I hit Fort Nelson. I lucked out and stayed dry for most of the morning while riding along Lake Muncho. I kind of wished I had camped next to the lake because it was absolutely beautiful. It had a deep aquamarine color and mountainous landscape surrounding it.<span id="more-753"></span></p>

<p>For most of the ride to Fort Nelson I had to deal with road construction and got stop multiple times waiting for a pilot car. At one patch they said I&#8217;d only have to wait 10 minutes but it ended up being almost an hour.</p>
<p>I was pretty lucky on the weather up until 30 miles outside Fort Nelson when it began to pour on me and hail. I had to slow down my speed to 20 mph because it felt like someone was stabbing me in the shin with an ice needle. Luckily the weather cell only last a few miles.</p>
<p>Just before I got to Fort Nelson I hit another stretch of road construction. I thought I was in the clear when it came to the weather as I could see blue skies in the distance. However, I was stopped right under a dark cloud and sure enough it started to rain on me while I was waiting for the pilot car. I could only help but laugh at my luck.</p>
<p>After filling up in Fort Nelson I hit the road as fast as I could. I could see blue skies in front of me and was looking forward to some nice riding weather. When I finally left the cloudy area I couldn&#8217;t help but shout in my helmet &#8220;WOOOOO.&#8221; It was the first blue skies I&#8217;d seen in 2 days. Even though the roads were long and straight, it was the most enjoyable riding I had had in a long time. I wouldn&#8217;t get stopped by road construction the rest of the day.<a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-761" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150725_141937557_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>After a long day of riding I finally made it to Dawson Creek where the Alaskan Highway begins. I made my way straight to the &#8220;World Famous Alaska Highway&#8221; sign to grab a quick photo.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-755" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7250088-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a>I ended up camping near the outskirts of town at Pioneer Park where I met two motorcyclist, a father and son. They were heading to Edmonton and Banff, where they lived, the following day so I asked them for some advice on where to stop on the way and what to see. I wasn&#8217;t able to get to sleep too early since there was a circus, literally, in the campground, but I was far enough south where it was finally starting to get dark again at night.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Anchorage -&gt; Tok (318 Miles)</a></p>
<p class="p1">I got a late start to the day because I hadÂ some business calls in the morning. I told myself not to worry about finding a job while on this trip, but a couple of opportunities kind of fell into my lap and I had to take advantage of them. I had one call left when I realized it was about to rain. I quickly packed my gear and left Anchorage as it was starting to shower. I was headed for Chicken, AK just north of Tok.<span id="more-708"></span></p>
<p class="p1">I took the Glenn Highway, which turned out to be one of the more scenic highways I took in Alaska. There were some glaciers right off the highway and beautiful rivers. Along the way I saw a Moose staring down the road with itâs jaw open and some weeds hanging in its mouth. It looked dumbfounded. I swear, Moose have got to be the dumbest animal ever.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-718" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220009-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a> <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-719" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7220003-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Up until this point I really hadn&#8217;t encountered all that many bugs. That changed on theÂ on this day.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-721" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150723_052310491_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Everything was great until I hit Glenallen. Then the heavens opened up and it poured on me for a few miles. I just just waterproofed my gloves and bought new rain pants. They passed this first test.</p>
<p class="p1">I had planned to make it to Chicken but because I got a late start I wasnât going to make it that far. Also, by the time I made it to Tok I could see some dark clouds off in the distance that I didnât feel like riding under. So I decided to stop in Tok and check out this motorcycle campground some guys in Fairbanks had recommended.</p>
<p class="p1">This wasnât your typical campground. They had some primitive tent spots but then they had some more unorthodox options like a teepee and ambulance. For $20 I was considering taking one of them sinceÂ I was planning to wake up early the next morning and didnât feel like having to pack my tent.</p>

<p class="p1">Unfortunately, both were reserved, but they had a bunk cabin that was set up similar to a hostel. There were four beds for $10 a piece. No one was there yet so I decided to grab one of those. I didnât really care if anyone else came, but it would suck for them when they found out I talked in my sleep and got night terrors.</p>

<p class="p1">For staying at the campsite I got this awesome sticker thatâs probably my favorite out of all the ones Iâve gotten this trip (Sorry for the profanity).</p>

<p class="p1">Just across from my cabin there was a guy sitting next to his BMW R1200. I saw on his canister that he had a sticker from Prudhoe Bay and started talking to him about his trip. He pretty much said it was hell riding up there. The gravel was 4 inches deep and he never rode any faster than 35mph.</p>
<p class="p1">Talking to him made me a bit nervous about my ride the next day on the Top of the World Highway considering its all gravel, but he assured me the road was well maintained and better than any road construction I had encountered all trip. I still bought an extra gas canister just in case considering it took me an hour to go 17 miles up to Salmon Glacier and the Top of the World Highway spanned ~70 miles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill and I wanted to camp at Wonder Lake in Denali National Park so we could wake up early and check out Mt. McKinley. We didn&#8217;t realize it would take 5.5 hours to busÂ 82 miles to the campsite. We got there too late and decided to take the shuttle the next morning. Unfortunately, the earliest shuttle at 5:15am was full so we bought tickets for the 6:15am and would should up early the next morning. We figured somebody would probably sleep in and miss the early bus. We showed up the next morning at 5:05am and were lucky enough to get on with no problems.<span id="more-690"></span></p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-696" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190283-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I think most people on the shuttle were there mainly to see the wildlife. I had already seen a lot at the zoo and conservation center, but it&#8217;s different to catch them in the wild. Within the first 20 minutes we saw a bull moose on the side of the road.</p>

<p>Along the ride we saw a few bear, but I didn&#8217;t have the best lens to get a good photo.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-692" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190343-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p>Seeing all these wild animalsÂ turned everyone in the bus into savages. You&#8217;d think we were seeing animals juggling flaming chainsaws while balancing on each other. Each time we saw an animal everyone would rush to one side of the bus.Â Bill said that the wildlife viewing was great, but the people watching was spectacular.Â It was at this point that I got my best photo of the day, possibly the whole trip.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-694" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190289-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I realized I already got some great animal pictures at the conservation center so I decided I rather just sit back and enjoy the experience. There were two guys that were especially adamant about getting photos of the animals. They were constantly on the prowl to spot the next bear or moose. One of them spotted something in the distance and yelled at the bus driver to stop. It turned out to be a road sign.</p>
<p>Every so often we&#8217;d stop to look at some sheep way off in the distance on the hills. They looked like small white spots, but you&#8217;d think these guys were looking at a rare species.Â We were heading back and someone spotted a bear. Bill and I were just sitting down not paying attention. Weâd seen plenty of bears. Then, all of a sudden we heard a loud âOOHHHHHâ from everyone. Apparently, it had stood up on itâs hind legs for a second. One of the guys sighed in disappointment because he wasn&#8217;t fast enough to get a photo.</p>
<p>I thought it was cool to see the wildlife, but I was more interested in the scenery. All I wanted from the day was a great photo of Mt. McKinley, but the weather was awful. Most of the day there was thick fog or rain and it was freezing cold. That picture up top is one I stole from Google image search. This is what it looked like for me:</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-704" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7190349-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>Our bus driver was quite the character. She talked the entire trip to and from Wonder Lake.Â It was cool at times because we pretty much got a free tour guide, but she loved to repeat herself. Sheâd say things like âLook at that bear digging. Heâs digging, digging, digging.â She also proceeded to explain to us why we weren&#8217;t going to be able to see Mt. McKinley that day, as if the amount of fog and rain wasn&#8217;t an obvious indication.Â The only decent visibility we had was in the beginning of the day and at polychrome pass.</p>

<p>After 5 hours on the road we finally made it to Wonder Lake and it wasn&#8217;t all that spectacular. The weather really ruined the view.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m determined to go back and get the photos of Mt. McKinley I want. Next time I plan to camp at Wonder Lake for a few days so I have a better chance to see the mountain. Mt. McKinley is so high that it makes it&#8217;s own unpredictable weather patterns. They say that only 30% of visitors get to see it.</p>

<p>For most of my stay, Bill had to work during the day but was nice enough to leave me his car. I wouldnât normally take him up on his offer, but it pretty much rained my entire trip. He recommended I take it down to Exit Glacier near Seward because itâs supposed to be a beautiful ride. The entire time down I wished I was out on my bike, but I was happy to be inside away from the rain.<span id="more-662"></span></p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-665" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7130002-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>It only took me about 20 minutes to get up to a vista where I could see the glacier, but I wanted to get on it. They only way to really get onto the ice is to head up to the Harding Icefields. I started talking to a ranger about how long it would take to get up there and he said around 8 hours. It was about 8 miles round trip and I figured I could do it in about 5. I was just about to head up, but the ranger insisted I not try it since it was late in the day. By the time I&#8217;d be heading down I would probably be alone and it would be around the time when wildlife (aka bears) are roaming around. I decided to pin it for another day, and glad I did because I definitely wasn&#8217;t prepared.</p>

<p>Later in the week, Bill took off a day from work and we headed down to Seward to camp for the night. It rained all night and we ended up camping in the back of his Suburban. The next morning we woke up early and started to hike up to the Harding Icefields. We had light showers early on Â and it was somewhat cool out. I was only wearing shorts and a t-shirt under my rain gear. The elevation change was pretty steep and after a while we both took off our rain coats to cool down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After about an hour we made it above the tree line and had a better view of the glacier. We couldnât see the ice fields yet because they were covered in a cloud. It was starting to get cooler as we got higher up and I had to put my rain jacket back on. Unfortunately, it was soaked, but it still kept me warm.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-681" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6650" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6650-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>For most of the hike up we were surrounded by trees, but now it was barren. The trail was covered in brokenÂ shale and granite boulders. Most people turn around once they hit the tree line, but we continued on. We had 2.5 miles to go.</p>
<p>The terrain started to get more difficult the higher we went. It was steep and the paths started to get more narrow. We took a lot of breaks on the way up, but they were only a few minutes to catch our breaths. We didnât want to let our bodies cool down too much.</p>

<p>As we got higher we started to see snow around us. It wasn&#8217;t until we had to walk on it that we realized we may not have prepared as well as we should have. Remember, I&#8217;m only wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and waterlogged rain gear. Things like gloves and hiking poles would&#8217;ve been ideal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time we&#8217;d hike up to a point we figured we&#8217;d have to be at the ice fields, but all we&#8217;d see is more trail going off into the distance. The temperature must have dropped 20Â° and the winds were starting to pick up. It got to the point where we felt like we were hiking Mount Everest or something. We couldn&#8217;t see all that far off in the distance, and we were surround by snow, ice, and rock.</p>

<p>We made it up to a storm shelter to take a quick break to eat some granola bars and write our names on the inside of the cabin. We only brought three granola bars, which would turn out to be a mistake on our 5 hour hike.</p>

<p>After another quarter mile we finally made it to the ice fields, but there was no easy way to actually walk on them. The winds had picked up to around 25 mph and you could almost lean into the wind and have it support you. We had to climb, not hike, down a slopping rock face to make it to the ice. I was getting pretty tired at this point and was dreading what the climb back up would be like.</p>

<p>At one point I feel like my butt was gettingÂ cold. I looked down and realized I hadÂ ripped the crotch of my rain pants straight down to my knees.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6803" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6803-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>As I&#8217;m trudging down, I see bill running down a snow slope and falling to his knees to slide down. He probably slide for a good 200 ft before stopping himself to avoid some rocks. I didn&#8217;t feel like risking an injury 4 mile away from help.</p>
<p>There was one point where we had to pass over a snow patch, which got me a bit worried. We were right at the ice fields and all I could think about are all those stories where glacier hikers fall through the snow into a crevasse. I let Bill go first to try it out before I followed.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-669" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6882" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6882-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We finally made it down to the ice fields and I&#8217;ve never felt more accomplished. Too bad I couldn&#8217;t really enjoy it because my body was coldÂ and exhausted. Bill&#8217;s hands were so cold he actually warmed them up in some of the glacier water.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-671" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6874" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6874-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After drinking some glacier water and filling up our water bottles we made the trek back up. The climbÂ was brutal. We hadn&#8217;t really eaten all that much and I was low on energy. I was barely able to climb more than a few feet before I had to take a break. The winds had slowed down by the glacier, but picked up as we got higher. On multiple occasions I told Bill &#8220;I just wanna lay down here and die.&#8221; It was that miserable.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-668" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6886" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6886-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>There was no stretch in the hike that took longer than the climb back up to the storm shelter. We made a quick stop to eat our last granola bar and Bill was nice enough to give me his. As we were standing there two guys showed up wearing only jeans and a rain jacket. I couldn&#8217;t imagine how miserable they were.</p>
<p>Luckily, the hike back down to the base was pretty easy. My quads had gotten pretty tired and I hadn&#8217;t realized how steep the climb was so my knees started to get sore. It took us about 3 hours to get up there and 2 to get back down. All that wast motivating Bill and I to get down to the car was the thought of some hot and spicy ramen soup. &#8220;Hot n Spicy Soup&#8221; was our mantra the whole way down.</p>
<p>As we were hiking down, we&#8217;d see people who were on their way to the ice fields and were even less prepared than we were. All I could think in my head was &#8220;You have no idea what you&#8217;re getting yourself into.&#8221;</p>
<p>We finally made it back to the parking lot, changed into some dry clothes, and heated some water for our soup. Bowl NoodlesÂ and a cold can of ravioliÂ never tasted so good.</p>

<p>The lodge was in the middle of nowhere and was only accessible by float plane. It looked pretty rough on the outside but had been renovated to be 5-star on the inside.</p>

<p>After signing some paperwork I hopped on a John boat with a father and his son visiting from Colorado and two guides. They dropped me off with my guide, Maddy, and we hiked up river in a waders for about a mile before we hit a fork in the river. On the way we saw someÂ bear paw prints in the mud banks. When we got to our fishing spot, Maddy pointed out some red spots in the water that were King Salmon. Unfortunately, King season was over and we were after Silvers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-650" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5011-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_5011" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5011-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5011-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5011-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5011-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></p>
<p>I had been taking casting lessons at the San Francisco Anglers Casting Club, but I was mainly using a 5 weight rod. For salmon fishing, I needed to use a 10 weight which is much heavier. The nice thing about salmon fishing is youâre using a sinking fly and donât have to worry about presenting it correctly on the water. According to Maddy, the salmon arenât even hungry. Youâre just trying to piss them off so that they attack the fly out of anger andÂ frustration.</p>
<p>Maddy was super excited to try out a new fly she had tied that morning that she described as a princess fly. It was pink and purple with some streamers in it. We later dubbed it âJasmine,â and Maddy may have found a whole new business making disney themed flies.</p>
<p>It only took about 20 minutes before I had my first bite. As it got closer to the surface we could see that it was a King Salmon and Iâm pretty sure Maddy was more excited than I was. I was happy just to have a fish on the line, but Maddy would later tell me that people come to Alaska just to catch Kings. To do it on a fly made it that much more impressive.</p>
<p>As I was backing up onto the bank, the salmon swam under some logs and got the line caught, but I was able to maneuver the tip of my rod around them and get it untangled.</p>

<p>I didnât catch anything the rest of the morning despite seeing silvers right in front of me. Nonetheless, it was still a great morning. The weather was perfect, there were no mosquitos, and I saw some bald eagles fly overhead. Other than a few rafts coming down the river, we were alone and the environment was peaceful.</p>
<p>After a quick lunch at the lodge we were back in the boat and headed for the same spot to look for trout. This time we got dropped off at the head of the river and didnât have to make the hike. I was excited to trout fish, despite it being less of a fight, because Iâd get to use my own rod. Up until this point, I had only used it to practice casting.</p>
<p>Instead of staying in the same spot, we walked down river and casted at different logs sitting on the banks. If nothing hit after a few casts, we moved on. My first catch was only a few inches but I was happy to finally have caught something on my rod.</p>

<p>Then we hit a log where I got back to back 18â trout.</p>

<p>There were some hungry Greyling too, but they were tiny.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-643" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_5029" width="629" height="839" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029-900x1200.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5029-1280x1707.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I started to get a bit ballsy and casted at a heavly wooded hole and got my fly caught. Maddy was pretty good at getting my fly unstuck earlier and I wanted to learn her technique. Pretty much she would do a roll cast to get the line behind the fly and then give it a quick pull. I gave it a few tries but I think I made things worse. I handed the rod to Maddy and she ended up catching it on just about ever knob and made a spider web with my line. I thought it was hilarious, but I could tell Maddy was not happy.</p>

<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-644" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_5034" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5034-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>I was totally fine with cutting the line and respooling it later, but Maddy was determined to get my line back. She hiked around the river, climbed on top of a beaver dam, and used a long stick to unhook my line. There were a few times where the dam started to break and I thought for sure she was going head first into the water.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an awesome day. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for better weather or a better guide.</p>
