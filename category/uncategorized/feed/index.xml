<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Takhini Hot Springs -&gt; Liard Hot Springs (419 Miles)</a></p>
<p class="p1">It ended up raining all night, but luckily I got a small window the next morning where it dried up so I could pack up my tent. My tent was wet, but I’d be at my next destination with plenty of time for it dry out. The forecast for the day was more rain so I decided to ditch my leather gloves in favor of some winter work gloves I got from Bill’s dad. They weren’t the most stylish but they kept my hands dry.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-742"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" size-full wp-image-743 aligncenter" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2.jpg" alt="PIP 58-7303-2" width="500" height="500" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2.jpg 500w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PIP-58-7303-2-88x88.jpg 88w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">These gloves may have kept my hands dry, but it didn’t keep them warm. I needed to find some hand warmers and thought I remembered seeing some at the gas station right before the Cassiar Highway intersection. In hindsight I should’ve just stopped in Whitehorse where I was guaranteed to find some since the gas station didn’t carry any.</p>
<p class="p1">I think I can safely say this was the worst day of riding I had yet. I never saw the sun, let alone any blue skies. It rained on me from the moment I left Takihini Hot Springs until I got within 30 miles of Liard Hot Springs. I couldn’t find hot packs anywhere I stopped. Also, my new rain pants I bought in Anchorage weren’t as great as I thought. They worked for a while, but then I noticed I was getting wet below my knees. It turns out that the high winds from riding had opened the seams and was letting water in so I sealed them with duck  tape to get by.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the stops I wanted to make was in Watson Lake to see the sign post forest. People from all over the country have come and put up signs from their home town. I wish I could&#8217;ve walked around and looked for one from Florida or San Francisco but it was one of the few breaks from the rain I got and I didn&#8217;t want to waste it standing around.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-745" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P7240069-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I stopped at a gas station that I thought was an hour away from the hot springs to warm up and grab food. I was talking with the owners and they gave me the best news of the day. I was actually only 35 miles away.</p>
<p class="p1">When I got to the hot springs I was lucky that it was only drizzling so I could set my tent up without it getting wet inside. Unfortunately, the ground was gravel and I don&#8217;t have a self support tent so I have to stake it down. I had to use the caveman technique and bash the stakes in with a large rock, which got the job done.</p>
<p class="p1">After I had my campsite set up and gear unpacked I headed over to the hot springs to relax. It&#8217;s about a half mile walk down a boardwalk from the campsite.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-751" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172419873_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">These hot springs were way neater than the ones at Takhini, because they were in a natural setting.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-749" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172320895_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The springs got cooler as you made your way away from the source on the far right. The bottom was soft gravel and they even had benches out in the middle where you could sit and relax.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-750" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_171205110_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Towards the cooler end of the springs they built some small water falls that you could sit under and have the water massage your back.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-746" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_174247785_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I was talking to one guy who had been there before and he said that the challenge is to pick up a rock and set it on the ledge where the spring originates. The key is to shuffle the water upwards because its only the top few inches that get really hot. I got within 5 feet and had to turn back. I could feel my eggs cooking.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-748" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR-900x507.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150724_172521561_HDR-1280x721.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">After a long day on the road, these springs were exactly what I needed. It&#8217;s unfortunate that I had to power through the day, but with all the bad weather and road construction there wasn&#8217;t much I could do.</p>

<p class="p1">The ultimate measure of a person is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=z1RZyrvrQJ3c.k5UyoACPlJto">Tok -&gt; Takhini Hot Springs (509 miles)</a></p>
<p class="p1">I woke up around 5:30am, quickly packed my gear, and headed for Chicken via the Top of the World Highway. I had a long ride ahead of me and I wanted to spend a few hours in Dawson City. I had planned it so that at the end I would be rewarded with a dip in some hot springs to sooth my sore butt.<span id="more-726"></span></p>
<p class="p1">The morning was pretty cold and I ended up having to stop half way to warm up my hands on my tailpipes. Along the way I saw my first bear cross the road and then a few miles before I reached Chicken I saw a pack of 4 wolf pups walking in the gravel.</p>
<p class="p1">I needed to refuel in Chicken before I head to Dawson City otherwise I would never make it. Unfortunately, Chicken is a small town and has only one gas station that has to be attended by a human. I got there around 7:30am but the store didn’t open until 8am. I spent my time walking around the grounds and checking out their antiques. This place felt like it was stuck in a decade way in the past.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-739" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230019-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I refueled as soon as I could and got back onto there road, which by this time had turned into gravel. It was gravel until about 10 miles before the border and turned into perfectly paved road. After that, it would be gravel for 70 miles.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-736" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230035-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Along the way I passed an RV and then after a few miles I noticed that my battery light came on. I quickly pulled over and accidentally let my bike kick off. My bike was dead.</p>
<p class="p1">I waited for a few minutes for the R.V. to roll up and flagged him down. Luckily the driver, also named John, had jumper cables<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and gave me a kick start. Like most of this trip has been for me, when it rains it pours. I have a screw that secures the battery cover. Well, as I was trying to put it back on I dropped the screw and we spent the next 15 minutes searching for it. Finally, John decided to go look for a bungie cable to secure it, but just as he’s going to his R.V. I found the screw stuck behind my pipe cover. I planned to keep my bike running the rest of the way until I hit Dawson City.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a reason why they call it the Top of the World Highway. For one, the border crossing there is the highest in elevation in North America.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-737" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230033-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Also, when you’re riding along the mountain tops you literally feel like your riding on top of the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-738" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230026-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The ride really wasn’t as bad as I was expecting. For the most part, there wasn’t all that much loose gravel and practically no potholes. I made it to the ferry with plenty of gas to spare, but when I got my bike on the boat they made me turn off the engine. I practically pleaded with them that if I turned it off it wouldn’t start again, but they said I either had to get off or turn off my engine. I turned it off and when we got to the other side, sure enough my bike was dead.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-734" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230048-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a> <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-733" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P7230042-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I ended up having to roll my bike off the ferry and go search for someone with jumper cables. I figured I wouldn’t have to look too long since there was a line up of trucks waiting for the ferry, but after asking around with no luck I was getting a bit worried. One guy thought he might have some, but his truck gave off the impression he was a hoarder and probably wouldn’t be able to find them anytime soon.</p>
<p class="p1">I started walking along the nearby houses trying to see if anyone was home and found two ladies sitting on their porch. Luckily they had jumper cables but weren’t willing to come kickstart my bike. They were too worried it would ruin their husband’s car. I took the cables, found the hoarder in line, and quickly kickstarted my bike while the ferry was pulling up to unload more cars. Luckily, there was an auto parts store in town that had one battery in stock that fit my bike.</p>
<p class="p1">I had wasted so much time that I really didn’t have much of a chance to explore Dawson City. It seemed like a neat little town, but after grabbing a quick bite to eat and snapping a few photos I was back on the road.</p>

<p class="p1">The ride from Dawson City to Takhini Hot Springs wasn’t all that eventful. In the beginning you can see a bunch of tailings from old mining operations, but other than that there really wasn’t much to see. I started to hit road construction not too long into my ride down and somehow timed every section at the worst time. I was always the first vehicle there and had to wait 20 minutes for the pilot car to show up. I easily rode more gravel this day than any other day this trip.</p>
<p class="p1">Towards the end of the day I started to get caught in some showers and I found out the hard way my gloves weren’t as waterproof as I had once thought. By the time I got to Takhini Hot Springs they were pretty damp. Luckily, I had the hot springs to rejuvenate me after a long days ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>When the student is ready the teacher will appear.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2002, my sister Erin passed away after contracting sepsis following a surgery. Since then, my other sister Jen has organized a fishing tournament in her memory to raise awareness about sepsis. This year marked the 13th annual <a href="http://www.bugsclassic.com/">B.U.G.S Classic fishing tournament</a>.<span id="more-177"></span></p>
<p>I enjoy the tournament because it&#8217;s a great time for me to come home and visit friends and family. Erin Connelly, one of Erin&#8217;s best friends and a third sister to me, always comes down from Georgia to help. This year, my uncle Paul and all three of his daughters came down as well. Generally, I only come for the weekend since I have work, but now that I&#8217;m funemployed, I took two weeks off to enjoy the pool, eat at Frenchy&#8217;s, and go for some day cruises with everyone.</p>

<p>Tournament week consists of two major events: the captains party on Thursday and the fishing tournament on Saturday. The captains party is the last opportunity for angler&#8217;s to register for the tournament but we also hold a silent auction and raffle. The raffle always includes some pretty cool Budweiser gear and this year we had a SweetWater Kayak.</p>
<p>Every year I think that the set up for the captain&#8217;s party gets easier and easier. Some of it is practice, but a lot of it has do with the core group of friends and family that know where to be and what to do. Also, we have a great venue at Kelly&#8217;s in Dunedin that give us the whole outdoor area to set up.</p>

<p>A few weeks before I was supposed to leave Google I got a message from my best friend Mark asking if I knew anyone with a boat for the tournament. At that point I was too busy trying to wrap things up  so I sent him over to Jen for help. Here&#8217;s his text:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Jen, this is Mark Faimalie. I had some interest in participating in this years B.U.G.S. Tournament and John suggested that I reach out to you. Obviously not having a boat or fishing pole, gear, or a lot of experience I realize that it&#8217;s probably a long shot but I figured it was worth a shot to see if you were aware of any openings on boats that would be willing to take on a greenhorn fisherman like myself for the tournament.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t in the same boat. I&#8217;m not sure why, but it seems that fishing skipped my generation. My sister and all her friends were avid fishermen and now my younger cousins&#8217; generation is too. Luckily, Jen was able to get us on a boat with George Lenoce, one of Erin&#8217;s old friends, who used to be a fishing captain himself.</p>
<p>On the morning of the tournament we all headed out on my dad&#8217;s new salt water pontoon boat, the B.U.G.S Tug. We used it as the starter boat and it&#8217;s where all the captain&#8217;s checked in to grab their measuring stick. Mark and I hopped onto George&#8217;s boat outside Erin Island with two cases of beer. I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a bad omen or not when George and his buddy said they wouldn&#8217;t be drinking, but Mark and I had all day to finish what we brought. I figured the day would have to be somewhat successful since we had live bait to start the tournament. The past four or five I&#8217;ve fished in it we&#8217;ve either had to get bait after the start or by the time we got to the first spot it was all dead.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-180" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o-1024x576.jpg" alt="11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o" width="629" height="354" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o-900x506.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o-1280x720.jpg 1280w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174595_10206796279334611_4314964161864449639_o.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>Our first stop was near the north end of Honeymoon Island. Our main target was snook, but all we could catch were trout and a sting ray. At one point I saw a sting ray jump a foot out of the water.</p>
<p>The nice thing about fishing with George is that he&#8217;s patient. With a lot of anglers, if the fish aren&#8217;t biting within the first 15 &#8211; 20 minutes, they are moving on to the next spot. We probably hung out there for at least two hours. Another trait about George is he&#8217;s a great teacher. He helped Mark and I bait our hooks but also explain why he hooked it in a certain place. He also explained why he chooses certain locations for different fish and how the tides affect them. George did all this despite money being on the line.</p>
<p>Our next stop was an area where it was shallow enough for us to wade in the water. Mark and I stayed on the boat until we saw that George was the only one catching anything while wading. At one point Mark thought he saw something swimming around him. I wasn&#8217;t too confident in his observation since he mistook the anchor for a fish earlier in the day, but it turned out to be a shark of some sort. Needless to say, we got back into the boat pretty quick.</p>
<p>By the end of the day we had caught some big trout, a small redfish, and no snook. We needed a snook to enter into the slam or a bigger redfish for the individual bracket if we had any chance to win. I am a true believer in beginner&#8217;s luck and Mark did not disappoint. At the last spot he landed a 21 2/3&#8243; redfish, good enough for 3rd place.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download_20150524_104338.jpeg"><img decoding="async" class=" size-full wp-image-187 aligncenter" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download_20150524_104338.jpeg" alt="download_20150524_104338" width="360" height="480" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download_20150524_104338.jpeg 360w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download_20150524_104338-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t have asked for better weather and a more fun day. Mark is already trying to figure out how he can get out on the water again and I&#8217;m right there with him. Here&#8217;s a highlight video of the day:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>How old would you be if you didn&#8217;t know how old you were?</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, my roommate and I decided to sign up to run Bay to Breakers. For those of you not from the bay area, Bay to Breakers is a 12K run starting near Embarcadero (Bay) and ending at the Great Highway near the ocean (Breakers). For those of you from the bay area, you know that this race is really just an excuse to dress up in ridiculous costumes, get drunk, and party all day.<span id="more-166"></span></p>
<p>So why did we decide to pay to run this when most people just partake in the debauchery? We thought it would motivate us to get in shape, but I guess spending $50 isn&#8217;t enough of an incentive. Unfortunately, my roommate wasn&#8217;t able to join me since he&#8217;s in Tokyo for work, so Shelley took his place.</p>
<p>I think my total training for this run was one outing with my old roommate and two 3 mile runs last week while I was home in Florida. Needless to say, I was pretty worried I would even be able to finish. I decided to make some mental rules to try to motivate me to the finish line:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not allowed to run slower than the following people, otherwise it&#8217;s just embarrassing: nude men, fatties, people in full suit costumes, dudes in tutus (unless they looked like actual runners) and anyone blowing a vuvuzela.</li>
<li>Gotta run up Hayes Hill. It sucks, but if I get it over with fast I can walk at the top.</li>
<li>No music until mile 3. My roommate never let me listen to music when we ran together, but we also never ran further than 3 miles.</li>
<li>Only walk once. It&#8217;s all downhill past mile 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the race went down in my head:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Start</strong></span></p>
<p>I had signed my roommate and I up for Corral B, which is for runners who average an 8-9 min mile. Apparently I was pretty optimistic about our training when I signed us up for that group. Shelley and I decide to hang back with Corral D, which makes me feel a bit more comfortable since we will be running with Gumbi and a bunch of girls dressed as snow globes. We hang out at the start for around an hour, check out all the costumes, and watch tortillas fly through the air.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-171" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825-1024x616.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="629" height="378" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825-1024x616.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825-300x181.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825-900x542.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825-1280x771.jpg 1280w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/unnamed-e1431973739825.jpg 1794w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mile 1</strong></span></p>
<p>So far so good. I&#8217;m not huffing and puffing like I thought I would be at this point and the crowd lining the road is motivating me. It could also be that we are probably running at an 11min mile pace. I spot a group of guys running in full bear costumes, can&#8217;t let them outrun me (Rule #1).</p>
<p><b><u>Mile 2</u></b></p>
<p>Still feeling good, and picking up the pace now that I&#8217;m getting warmed up. I&#8217;m finding it difficult to actually keep a steady pace since I&#8217;m weaving around people walking. Don&#8217;t they know there was a group for those type of participants? Now I see Shelley taking some candid photos of me from behind, probably for her Instagram post later. I spot my first nude guy, gotta pass him (Rule #1).</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpeg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image-768x1024.jpeg" alt="image" width="629" height="839" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image-768x1024.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image-225x300.jpeg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image-900x1200.jpeg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image-1280x1707.jpeg 1280w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>We turn slightly onto Hayes and I see the hill. It&#8217;s packed with people and doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to be much fun. I see some people dressed as salmon &#8220;swimming upstream&#8221; against all the runners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mile 3</strong></span></p>
<p>This hill really sucks. I&#8217;ve run the hill outside of Shoreline Amphitheater multiple times with my roommate so I should be able to do this. Again, people are walking all over the pace making it hard for me to stay in my mental zone. There are people lining the road having a huge block party and all I want to do is stop running and party the rest of the day. I make it to the top and have to walk (Rule #2). My chest is pounding and I can barely breathe. I really wish I would&#8217;ve trained for this.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mile 4</strong></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to put my headphones in and listen to some music (Rule #3). Hopefully I can space out and the next three miles will be a blur. I can already tell people have dropped off the race to party in Alamo Square for the rest of the day. I think I need to add another type of person Rule #1: anyone wearing USC and Michigan gear.</p>
<p>Yung Wun&#8217;s &#8220;Tear it up&#8221; comes up on my playlist and all I can think about it is the movie <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drumline</span><strong> </strong>starring Nick Cannon</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mile 5</strong></span></p>
<p>I snap out of my Nick Cannon day dream at a bottleneck and figure we must be coming up on mile marker 6, but unfortunately it&#8217;s only mile 5. My groin and quads are getting super sore and start to walk. Damn, I broke rule #4. I&#8217;m instantly regretting that I walked, my groin and quads hurt more now. I just need to power through two and half more miles.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mile 6</strong></span></p>
<p>Man, my groin really hurts. I hope I&#8217;m going to be able to walk tomorrow. At least there aren&#8217;t a bunch of people walking and I can keep a consistent pace the rest of the way. A guy in a tutu just passed me, but he&#8217;s way too fast. I&#8217;m just going to assume he&#8217;s a runner (Rule #1). I see mile marker 6, only one and half to go.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mile 7</span></strong></p>
<p>I see the field where Hardly Strictly is every year. I zone out again thinking about my cousin&#8217;s band, The Lil Smokies, and if I&#8217;ll be able to catch one of their shows this year. I snap out of my daze turning a corner where a bunch of people are banging some island drums. I see mile marker 7, only half a mile to go. Should I pick up the pace? Nah, I&#8217;ve come this far, better just finish.</p>
<p><b><u>Finish</u></b></p>
<p>I can see a large screen on the beach recording everyone as they make the last turn to the finish line. Oh god, I haven&#8217;t been paying attention. Are my nipples bleeding? Thank god they&#8217;re not, that would be embarrassing. I guess I can pick up the pace for the last 100yds.</p>
<p>Shelley and I pass the finish line, high five to a completed race, and beeline it for the food. Apparently times have changed since the last time I&#8217;ve run at an event. Instead of bananas, they have boxed water and chips for us.</p>

<hr />
<p>Shelley and I ended up finish in 1:25:50, which amounts to an 11 min 25 sec mile pace. I was a little disappointed, but considering I didn&#8217;t train at all for this run, I&#8217;ll take it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is coming to you from behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">the Great Firewall</a>. Luckily for me, I&#8217;m staying with Yao&#8217;s friend, Yuming, and he has a VPN that lets us still access things like Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yao and I got up early and left to get xiao long bao (soup dumplings).<span id="more-57"></span> These are by far my favorite food item I&#8217;ve gotten on the trip so far. I&#8217;m a fan of the pan-fried ones over boiled. Yao says that Shanghai is the only place he&#8217;s been to that has good fried XLBs.</p>
<p>We hopped on the subway and headed to Tianzifang. It&#8217;s a renovated residential area with arts and crafts stores. Despite the modern stores, it still has a traditional feel with its classic architecture.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" style="width: 633px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-64" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884-623x1024.jpg" alt="Tianzifang" width="623" height="1024" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884-623x1024.jpg 623w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884-182x300.jpg 182w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884-900x1480.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429980119884.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-64" class="wp-caption-text">Tianzifang</p></div>
<p>For lunch, we headed to the Google office in Pudong. It&#8217;s on the 60th floor of the Shanghai World Financial Center, giving it a great view of the Pearl Tower. After eating, we headed to Nanjing Road and stopped by the Fairmont Peach Hotel, originally the Cathay Hotel. During the early 20th century, it was regarded as the most prestigious hotel in Shanghai and roomed many international celebrities.</p>
<p>Next we headed to the Bund for an iconic photo of Pudong (main picture). Apparently, I look like someone famous because as we were walking along the waterfront I was approached by some women to have my photo taken with them.</p>
<div id="attachment_66" style="width: 633px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66" decoding="async" class="wp-image-66 size-large" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429981013213-623x1024.jpg" alt="" width="623" height="1024" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429981013213-623x1024.jpg 623w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429981013213-182x300.jpg 182w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429981013213-900x1480.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wpid-wp-1429981013213.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /><p id="caption-attachment-66" class="wp-caption-text">Paparazzi trying to get some action</p></div>
<p>After posing for some photos, we walked back to Nanjing road to look at the shops and find some weird candy Yao was looking for. We went into the No. 1  Shanghai food store. By No.1 I don&#8217;t mean the best food store in Shanghai. Back in the day, government mandated how things were sold and created separate department-like stores for each type of good. So there was one store for food, another for clothing, and so on. Each branch was given a number which was representative of its size.</p>
<p>As we left the store we were approached by a street vendor who wanted to sell us some fake watches. I had never shopped for fake goods so I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. We were led through a dark alley, through a small door, up some steps barely big enough for my feet, and into someone&#8217;s home. At first, I was pretty sketched out, but the room with the goods was like any normal store. I&#8217;m not really that good at knowing which fakes are the good ones so I decided not to buy anything.</p>
<p>We continued walking along Nanjing road and bought some crafts from a peddler. Out of no where, a man came and tried to snatch the goods out of the sellers hands and pushed him out of the way. Apparently this is how they discourage illegally selling goods on the street. We followed the man for a bit and any time a seller saw him they ran off like frightened children into the alleys. At first it was kind of funny, but I began to feel bad when one lady tried to get her goods back. This is obviously how she makes a living and supports herself.</p>
<p>Up until this point I was wondering where all of the 14 million people in Shanghai were. None of the subway trips had been very full and I didn&#8217;t think there was an extraordinary number of people on the streets. That changed on the subway back to  Yuming&#8217;s place. The terminal was packed with people and we could barely get into one of the subway cars.</p>
<p>Later in the night we headed out to a small Japanese bar/restaurant to meet up with some of Yao&#8217;s high school friends and have a few too many drinks. I was able to find this funny sign in the bathroom:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have one more full day in Shanghai before we leave for Tokyo on Monday.</p>
