<p style="text-align: center;">Bantu tribesman, it is said, sneak into the rooms of their children as they sleep and whisper in their ears, &#8220;Become who you are.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of my Fundamentals of Business Thinking course in 2007, my professor, Jeff Sucec, gave us his book &#8220;Become who you are.&#8221; It is a compilation of quotes and thoughts that have inspired him. On the first page is the quote above.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recently, I decided to leave my job as a technical project manager at Google working for the Wallet risk team.<span id="more-1"></span> I didn&#8217;t leave because I hated Google, who could with all the free food and perks? I didn&#8217;t leave because of the people, Google hires the best and brightest in the world. I left partly because of burnout, but I did that to myself. The bigger reason I left was because I didn&#8217;t feel like working in e-commerce was reflective of who I was.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I embark on my next career, whatever that may be, I decided I wanted to travel and experience the world. If you had asked me a few years ago if I would do something like this my answer would have been &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not a hippy.&#8221; Well, here I am going on my hippy adventures in some hope that I will get a better sense of who I am.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the next few months I will be traveling to Asia, taking <a href="http://www.richoliver.net/">Rich Oliver&#8217;s Mystery Course</a>, visiting home, traveling to Europe, and going on a solo road trip on my motorcycle if time and money permit. My family constantly nags me for photos and updates about my life. I wish they would just get on snapchat and view my stories. I know they won&#8217;t, so here is my attempt to appease them and entertain the rest of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before we get started, there are some things you should know about my writing style:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">I have none. I&#8217;m a really bad writer.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">I love quotes, but hopefully I&#8217;ll pull some out that you haven&#8217;t read before.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">I write like I think, which sometimes doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can deal with these, then I hope you enjoy reading about my adventures for the next few months.</p>
