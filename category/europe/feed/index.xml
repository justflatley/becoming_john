										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After traveling throughout Asia and Europe the past few months I decided to share some tips on how I was able to do it on a budget and avoid inconveniences like buying separate sim cards each place I went.<span id="more-333"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Use flight deal sites to find the best price and be patient.</strong></p>
<p>Part of traveling on a budget involves patience and scouring flight deal sites. I don&#8217;t mean orbitz/kayak/expedia. I&#8217;m not a big fan of those because you often don&#8217;t get to choose your seats. I like to use www.theflightdeal.com and www.secretflying.com. Between these two sites I was able to book my trip to Hong Kong/Shanghai/Tokyo for $675 and to Stockholm for $600.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get Global Entry and <strong>TSA Pre<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</strong></strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing I hate more than waiting in lines. With Global Entry and TSA Pre<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> you&#8217;ll get to coast through the security and immigration lines in the U.S. Also, you don&#8217;t have to take all your clothes off or remove your electronics just to go through security. My advice, get Global Entry. It&#8217;s $100 for five years and you get TSA Pre<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for free.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Scandinavia as a gateway to Europe.</strong></p>
<p>Traveling to Europe can be expensive, especially during the summer. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to live in San Francisco, Orlando, or Los Angeles you can often find super cheap flights in and out of Oslo or Stockholm on Norwegian. By super cheap I mean $350 round trip cheap. Other airlines also provide cheap flights in an out of those cities, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend staying there too long. Both Oslo and Stockholm are extremely expensive, but you can find cheap flights to the major cities in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stay at an Airbnb over hotels.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten over the age where I want to stay at a hostel. Sure they&#8217;re fun and you get to meet a lot of people, but when I&#8217;m traveling with a significant other I just want to have my own room. I used to be a fan of www.hotwire.com to find good deals on hotels, but now I&#8217;m finding Airbnb is a much better option. They are cheaper than a hotel, have more amenities like a refrigerator, and if you get lucky you may get one where you meet your host and can get some local guidance on where to eat and go out. So far I haven&#8217;t had a bad experience, but I also only book rooms with someone who has plenty of positive reviews.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get T-Mobile.</strong></p>
<p>One of the inconveniences of traveling abroad is cell service. In many countries you can get by with using internet at bars and cafes, but why risk it? T-mobile has free international roaming. I visited five different countries in Europe and didn&#8217;t have to bother buying a separate sim card each place I went. If you&#8217;re not on T-Mobile, you can often find a deal on their website for a $.99 sim card and ask a friend to add them to your family plan. It ended up being $30 with activation and taxes, but it beat buying a $15 &#8211; $30 sim card each place we went.</p>
<p>Although the data roaming is free, the speed is throttled. Even with the speeds throttled, I was still able to navigate using Google maps, search local places, upload photos to snapchat and using a messaging app like WhatsApp. What else could you really need abroad?</p>
<p><strong>6. Buy your museum tickets ahead of time.</strong></p>
<p>Most attractions you&#8217;ll want to visit will require a ticket. If you&#8217;re traveling through Europe I highly recommend you purchase them ahead of time. Places like the Vatican Museums, Colosseum, and Anne Frank&#8217;s house consistently have long lines. However, if you purchase your tickets ahead of time you can bypass the line.</p>
<p><strong>7. Get a Charles Schwab checking account.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing I hate more than paying a fee that I don&#8217;t have to, especially when it comes to converting money. Any time you exchange cash for another currency you&#8217;re getting screwed, unless you&#8217;re in Argentina and you&#8217;re trading it to someone on the street. One time I exchanged $300 in Berlin and received the equivalent of $240 in euros. My best advice is to get a Charles Schwab checking account and take money out of an ATM once you&#8217;ve landed at your destination. Charles Schwab refunds any ATM fees and will give you the best conversion rate.</p>
<p><b>8. Get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees.</b></p>
<p>Like I said before, I hate paying unnecessary fees. Most credit card companies charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. There are plenty of choices out there for fee free cards, but most charge a yearly fee. I carry a Barclaycard Arrival Plus card but I have many friends that like the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. Barclay also has a no fee version of it&#8217;s card but gives you less points per dollar. I would recommend during some research online to see which one fits your needs bests.</p>
<p><strong>9. Use The Man in Seat 61 for your train itinerary.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re traveling through Europe by train it can get a bit daunting to figure out the best way to get around. I found www.seat61.com to be the best resource on the web. This site gives you multiple options for how to get to a destination and links you directly to the travel site to book your tickets. I wouldn&#8217;t have known about the <a href="./../../../2015/06/bernina-express/index.html">Bernina Express</a> had I not used this site. Like booking a flight, be patient as there&#8217;s usually deals on train tickets where you can get first class tickets for only a few more dollars than second class.</p>
<p><strong>10. Don&#8217;t plan everything you&#8217;ll do.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that has to have everything planned. Many of you aren&#8217;t like that and I applaud you. However, if you&#8217;re like me and have to plan everything out, try to leave some space for the unexpected. I had planned our transportation, housing, and wrote down some sites we wanted to see in Europe but let the environment dictate what we did. If we saw a cool street we wanted to walk down, we did it. If there was a cute square where we wanted to sit and have a drink, we did it. We couldn&#8217;t have done this if we had had a strict time table, so leave some time for the unexpected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like Paris, it rained hard on our first night so we didn&#8217;t do much exploring. Luckily, as we traveled further North the days got longer. By the time we got to Amsterdam the sun set at 10pm so we&#8217;d have a lot of time to explore.<br />
<span id="more-330"></span><br />
We didn&#8217;t have much on the agenda to see in Amsterdam and planned to roam around the city and stop by anything that looked interesting. We first stopped by a Tulip market along one of the canals that was pretty busy. Next, we stumbled upon the Royal Palace. It wasn&#8217;t anything too special, but the square was busy with people and loud street organ.</p>

<p>I had forgotten that the Anne Frank house was in Amsterdam and when I went to buy tickets online they were already sold out for the days we would be visiting. We decided to stop by anyway and see the Westerkerk church where Rembrandt is buried. Also, this is where the Westertoren bell tower is that Anne Frank said she could hear from her building. There was no chance of us getting into Anne Frank&#8217;s house when we stopped by. The line was already 200 people long.</p>

<p>As we continued down the canals we stumbled upon a cheese museum with the widest variety of gouda I&#8217;d ever seen. Like I said in an earlier post, Shelley and I aren&#8217;t big art enthusiasts, but we do love food.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-342" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030337-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-343" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030335-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>After stopping by the central train station we walked through the red light district. I felt like I had been dropped into a mix between the Castro and Folsom Street Fair. Despite it being light out, we still saw some girls in the windows along the side streets and guys were still going in. It was stark dichotomy to see these prostitutes in windows with The Oude Church in the background.</p>
<div id="attachment_344" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-344" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367-1024x768.jpg" alt="Red light district during the day" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030367-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-344" class="wp-caption-text">Red light district during the day</p></div>
<p>After taking a short break, we continued to the Heineken Experience which was right behind our hotel. The beginning of the tour was like any other brewery tour. You get to see the history of how their beer was made, the advertising and usually some horses. After that, the Heineken Experience goes for a hip and modern feel to cater to a younger generation.</p>

<p>At one point there&#8217;s a beer tasting portion. Who the hell does a beer tasting? It&#8217;s not like this is some high quality wine or whisky.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-348" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6030406-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p>The second half of the tour was all about new age branding. There were rooms with all their soccer promotions, light shows, and I even had an opportunity to do a bit of DJing.</p>

<p>While getting my free drink I was speaking to a couple who said that if I wanted a low key brewery experience that we should check out Brouwerij &#8216;t IJ. It was located only a short tram ride from our hotel and was connected to an old windmill. I wanted to try a beer flight, but it was so popular that all their glasses were in use. Instead, I settle for an ale the bartender recommended. We also grabbed an order of ossenworst, which is a raw beef sausage originating in Amsterdam. Once you get past the fact you&#8217;re eating raw beef, it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day we hung out near Rembrandt square and had some drinks while we watched people pass by. I had to grab a Guinness because it tastes so much better in Europe.</p>
<p>If Amsterdam is known for anything else other than tulips, windmills and the red light district it&#8217;s the coffee shops. These coffee shops aren&#8217;t your typical Philz Coffee or Starbucks. They specialize in a different kind of drug that&#8217;s hard to miss. With names like Coffee Shop Smokey and Coffee Shop Reefer, I think you get the idea.<a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-360" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6040502-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a>The last site we wanted to see for sure was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">I Am</span>sterdam sign outside the Rijksmuseum. It was definitely a tourist desitination, but there were plenty of locals hanging out on the quad. We met a couple traveling from Maryland who had been in Amsterdam all week. I felt a lot better when we started discussing museums and they were on the same page with us about not caring about visiting the art museums. I guess there are other uncultured people out there as well.</p>

<p>On our last day we wanted to visit some of the outdoor markets. On the way I stopped by a cafe with a bunch of vending machines filled with hot food. I had been wanting to try a croquette the entire trip, but it wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting. It was pretty much a fried stick filled with beef gravy and it was delicious.</p>

<p>The first market we visited was the Waterlooplein Market. It was pretty much a huge flea market with some souvenir shops. We spent a few hours looking at the dutch antiques and I almost walked away with some old wooden ice skates that you tether to the bottom of your shows.</p>

<p>One thing that caught my eye was this stand where a man was making mini dutch pancakes called poffertjes. It was apparently a family run business that the man&#8217;s grandfather had started. The pancakes were topped with a huge slick of butter and powdered sugar. Needless to say, my mouth is watering just thinking about them.</p>

<p>The last market we stopped by was Albert Cuyp Market, which was behind our hotel. This market was more centered around produce and food items than commodities. We grabbed some Belgian style fries with peanut sauce and mayo for our last meal before heading to the airport.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We started off our first morning by grabbing pastries at a boulangerie around the corner from our Airbnb. Like the restaurant from the previous night, nothing was in english and the lady behind the counter only spoke french. Despite this, we were able to order by pointing and using hand gestures. I don&#8217;t know why, but the lady kept speaking to us in french even though we said we only spoke english.<span id="more-293"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Next we headed over to the Place de la Bastille where the storming of the bastille occurred during the French Revolution. Unfortunately, the prison was torn down during the 18th century and all that remains is a large round about with overpriced restaurants and large column in the center.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the things we wanted to do while in Paris was put a &#8220;love lock&#8221; on one of the bridges. I knew that the Pont des Arts was closed because they were removing the railings. All the locks had added too much weight to the bridge and was jeopardizing its structural integrity. We opted for the Pont de l&#8217;Archevêché near the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-298" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010039-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You could see where they were beginning to put plexiglass to block people from putting more locks on. It was near impossible to find any place to put our hefty lock, but I was able to find a spot near the bottom of the railing. Some people might consider it vandalism, but I think of it more like tradition. Being a graduate of the University of Notre Dame I&#8217;m all about tradition. You&#8217;re also supposed to throw the keys into the river, but I draw the line at littering. I’m sure our lock will either get cut off or replaced in the near future, but it was still fun.</p>

<p class="p1">We continued over to Notre Dame Cathedral and I was completely amazed by its beautiful gothic architecture. I could spend hours walking around the outside looking at the large flying buttresses and gargoyles.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-299" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010052-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">Inside, you get a good view of all the french stained glass and high ceilings. Apparently, at one point in the cathedral&#8217;s history they decided to remove all the stained glass for clear glass and painted the walls white. Luckily, there was a huge restoration to bring it back.</p>

<p class="p1">After grabbing and expresso at a local student center we walked over to the Luxembourg Gardens. It was fun park where we sat down and relaxed for a while. In the middle there&#8217;s a small pond where you could rent miniature sail boats.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-303" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010103-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Most people go to Paris for the art museums, but that’s not a big interest of ours. Call us uncultured, but we wouldn’t really appreciate it. Not to mention, things like this:<a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-320" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa-677x1024.jpg" alt="mona-lisa" width="629" height="951" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa-677x1024.jpg 677w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa-198x300.jpg 198w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa-900x1362.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mona-lisa-1280x1936.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">end up looking like this:</p>

<p class="p1">Nonetheless, ever since seeing Eurotrip, I’ve always wanted to get a picture in front of the glass pyramid entrance to the Louvre Museum. Unfortunately, there was no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aMD4uy-QGc">robot man dance off</a> like in the movie.</p>
<div id="attachment_306" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-306" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-306" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130-1024x768.jpg" alt="Outside the entrance to Louvre Museum" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010130-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-306" class="wp-caption-text">Outside the entrance to Louvre Museum</p></div>
<p class="p1">On our way over to the Louvre Museum we decided to stop by the Pont des Artes to see what it looked like before the started removing the railings. Apparently they were removing them that day because the police had blocked off the bridge. There were a bunch of news crews there and funny enough the crew from BFMTV asked if they could interview me. They must have recognized me from my celebrity shoot in Shanghai. I couldn&#8217;t deny the people their opportunity to hear from an international star so I agreed to the interview.</p>

<p class="p1">We continued through Tuileries Garden to the Luxor Obelisk where there was a stand making crepes. We grabbed a Ham/Cheese and Chocolate Banana crêpe. These were the best crêpes I had ever had since they were made fresh right in front of us.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-307" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010137-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">Off in the distance we saw a gold dome and decided to head towards it not knowing what it was. When we got closer we ran into the Museo Armee where you can see the history of the French military. I may not be into art, but I’m definitely into war and military history. Unfortunately, the museums were closed that day, but we could still visit Napoleon’s Tomb.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-309" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010183-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I was a little confused why his tomb was in Paris since I remembered learning in high school that he died on the island of Saint Helena where he was exiled. Apparently, King Louis-Philippe order troops to retrieve Napoleon’s body and built a tomb in Paris to house his ashes and the remains of people close to him. It&#8217;s a pretty impressive tomb for a man that was so small.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-310" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010181-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Next, we headed to the Eiffel Tower where you&#8217;ll find people lounging around on the grassy quad. They had also set up a viewing area for the French Open. Unfortunately, people in France are chain smokers. Everywhere we went we&#8217;d see people smoking. As a result, there were tons of cigarette buds all over the quad.</p>
<p class="p1"> <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-311" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010193-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">Next we stopped by the Arc de Triomphe de l&#8217;Étoile which sits in the middle of a huge roundabout with 12 street exits. Like most things nowadays you have to pay to go under the arc so we decided to enjoy it from the outside.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-314" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010249-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">One of the great things about staying in an Airbnb is being able to ask your host for recommendations where to eat and how to navigate the city. Without talking to ours we wouldn&#8217;t have known how to properly order tap water (Une carafe d&#8217;eau) or to look for restaurants with &#8220;fait maison&#8221; written on the outside. It literally means homemade so you shouldn&#8217;t get any frozen premade food. I was reading that the interpretation of this may have changed and some restaurants add a few spices to pre-made food and call it fait maison. Nonetheless, we got some steak and frites nearby at Mon Cafe. Shelley got a bleu cheese burger and it was the best I&#8217;d ever tasted. Instead of crumbles it had a large slice that melted into the meat.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-315" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P6010258-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a>At sunset, we headed up to Sacré-Cœur for a view of the city. This was more of a hang out area than a church. You&#8217;ll also find people selling beer if you didn&#8217;t bring your own.</p>

<p>The next morning, before heading to our train for Amsterdam we stopped by Ladurée. It&#8217;s a bakery from the 19th century that is famous for its macaroons. They are bit overpriced but still delicious and worth the stop.</p>

<p class="p1">We tried getting fondue at the one of the restaurants but apparently it&#8217;s only a winter thing. We opted to get pasta and pizza at Vapiano. I couldn&#8217;t believe the prices. Things were priced double or more than what you could find in the U.S. Later we&#8217;d see burgers at Burger King costing the equivalent of $18. The best part though was the free gummy bears at the hostess desk.</p>

<p class="p1">After dinner, Vishnu took us on a late night tour of the Google Zurich office. I am convinced every other office is way cooler than the Mountain View office. In Zurich they have slides, fire poles, and gondola conference rooms. The best part was the Water Lounge. It&#8217;s a dark room with aquariums, birds chirping and comfortable couches. There was even a bathtub filled with foam cubes. We took a short break to rest our eyes but I could’ve slept there all night.</p>

<p class="p1">The next morning we had planned to see the waterfalls on the Rhine but woke up late. With our last few hours we opted to walked around Zurich Old Town and ended up by the lake. We sat along the waterfront and enjoyed the scenery while children fed the geese and an old man fished out coins people had dropped in the water.</p>

<p class="p1">We caught a mid day train to Paris, checked into our next Airbnb where we were welcomed by one of our host&#8217;s friend. Then we grabbed some dinner at a brasserie around the corner. Unfortunately, it was going to rain the rest of the day so we grabbed a bottle of Bourdeaux wine and enjoyed some Dexter on Netflix to end the night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For one of our days in Europe we decided to train all day from Venice to Zurich. That may not sound like a lot of fun, but we took the scenic Bernina Express through the Swiss Alps. We started early and trained from Venice to Milan and transferred to a train headed for Tirano. <span id="more-258"></span>We met a friendly married couple from Tennesse and you could tell they were excited to be around someone who spoke English. The husband was in Milan for work and his wife joined him for the past six months. They talked our ear off but luckily they only rode halfway to Varenna.</p>
<p class="p1">The scenery from Milan to Tirano was beautiful. For most of the way we were riding along Lake Como and surrounded by mountains. Unfortunately, it was a bit hazy so we didn&#8217;t get a great view of the hillsides but you could pick out olive groves and vineyards.</p>

<p class="p1">We had a few hours in Tirano so we grabbed lunch at a cafe near the station and watched a tour train chauffeur people around the square.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-261" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5300248-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">When we got onto the Bernina Express we didn&#8217;t see any seats on our tickets. Apparently, I hadn&#8217;t made reservations for the panoramic coaches, which were the whole reason we were taking this train. It was an extra 14 CHR to get seats and I was glad. We were joined on the train by another friendly lady from Chicago who wanted to chat our ear off. Luckily, we pawned her off on another couple from New Zealand so we could enjoy the ride and scenery.</p>

<p class="p1">This train ride was one most scenic and beautiful trips I&#8217;ve ever been on. At some points I felt like I had been dropped into <em>The Sound of Music</em>. Words don&#8217;t do the trip justice so I&#8217;ll let the pictures do the talking:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our second destination was Venice. We were only going to be there for one night so we took the early train from Rome. We got in around noon, but weren’t able to check into our airbnb until 1:30pm. <span id="more-242"></span>We walked about half way to the apartment and stopped for lunch at Majer. There was a nice square near Chiesa di San Giacomo dall&#8217;Orio so we grabbed a bench and enjoyed our sandwiches.</p>
<p class="p1">I had been a bit worried about our airbnb because our host, Stefano, said he would be giving us the address for his apartment as our stay got closer. We still hadn’t heard from him despite messaging and texting him until the day before. Nonetheless, Stefano was a great host and had a trendy room of us with a projector screen, movies, and alcohol. The great thing about airbnb’s is you have a host that knows about the city you’re in and can give suggestions on where to eat and what to see.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-253" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1-1024x683.jpg" alt="61284de3_original(1)" width="629" height="420" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1-900x600.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1-1280x853.jpg 1280w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61284de3_original1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Unlike most cities, Venice has no order to it’s street structure. There’s no straight shot to any destination, but luckily I had my old roommate Ben add me to his T-Mobile family plan before we left. T-mobile gives free international texting and data. The data is throttle to a slower speed, but it’s still fast enough to use Google Maps. I highly recommend it if you’re ever traveling abroad because you don’t have to worry about getting a different sim card for each country you visit.</p>
<p class="p1">There aren’t many big sites to see in Venice so we decided to wander and follow signs for whatever site was nearby. We first stopped by the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge, but much like the sites in Rome, it was under construction as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_243" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-243" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-243" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022-1024x768.jpg" alt="Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290022-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-243" class="wp-caption-text">Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge</p></div>
<p class="p1">We continued on to Piazza San Marco where the basilica like the Rialto Bridge, was also under construction. Luckily the inside was untouched and were able to enjoy the ornate ceiling. Outside in the large square we encountered our old friends the selfie stick sellers. I’m convinced they are henchmen for the mafia.</p>

<p class="p1">Off in the distance we could see the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute and decided to head that way. Like I said before, there&#8217;s no easy way to get anywhere in Venice, so we did our best navigating the streets. On our way, we stopped by some shops to look at the Murano glass sculptures and bought a Sicilian cannoli at a bakery.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-250" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290100-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">One tip I should mention, don&#8217;t take a picture of the first gondola you see, they are everywhere. At every canal we passed we saw gondoliers steering boats full of passengers. We only found one that had someone singing &#8220;That&#8217;s Amore.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-248" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290065-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For dinner, we went Barabbaria for some pizza and wine. It was in the corner of a large square. The pizza was okay, but we enjoyed watching some college students kick a soccer ball around. We didn&#8217;t finish our bottle of wine and decided to save it for our trip to Zurich the following day. Afterwards, we went to a gelateria called Suso that Stefano had recommended and it was by far the best I had in Italy.</p>
<div id="attachment_251" style="width: 587px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251" decoding="async" class="wp-image-251 " src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166-e1433267335488-768x1024.jpg" alt="Tiramisu and chocolate gelato" width="577" height="770" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166-e1433267335488-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166-e1433267335488-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166-e1433267335488-900x1200.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290166-e1433267335488-1280x1707.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-251" class="wp-caption-text">Tiramisu and chocolate gelato</p></div>
<p class="p1">Once it was dark we headed back to Piazza San Marco where small bands were playing outside some restaurants. Each would take it&#8217;s turn and when they were done the crowd would migrate to the next stage.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-252" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5290175-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We ended the night watching <em>Catch Me If You Can </em>on the projector while enjoying some limoncello.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The last major attraction we had yet to see was the Colosseum. Luckily, it was only a 10 minute walk away from our hotel and on the way we stopped by a cafe for croissants and cappuccino. Pro tip, there&#8217;s a bridge crossing over Via degli Annibaldi where you can get a great picture.<span id="more-221"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-222" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280065-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a>Like the Vatican museums, we had purchased our tickets ahead of time and were able to skip a long line. Unfortunately, like most sites we saw in Rome, the Colosseum is undergoing restoration, but it didn’t obstruct any of the viewing areas.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-223" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280081-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">They also have a small museum where they show some of the artifacts that have been excavated over the years. They&#8217;ve used them to create some small scale models of what the Colosseum probably looked like and how all the ramps and pulley systems were used to raise animals to the fighting stage. They say it was even possible to flood the Colosseum for naval games.</p>
<p class="p1">Right next to the Colosseum is the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. This is essentially where Rome started. We walked around for a few hours and enjoyed the views from the hill side the most.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-224" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280147-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We continued up to Piazza Venezia, but were too hungry to stay long.</p>
<div id="attachment_226" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-226" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208-1024x768.jpg" alt="Vittorio Emanuele II" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280208-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-226" class="wp-caption-text">Vittorio Emanuele II</p></div>
<p class="p1">Instead, we went down a side street for lunch and grabbed some pizza and gelato. I ordered Snickers and Nutella. I thought they meant Nutella gelato, but it was straight up Nutella. Nonetheless, it was still pretty good and we enjoyed our meal on the steps as some guys dressed as Roman soldiers posed for pictures.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-227" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280212-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">After resting at the hotel for a bit, we headed out to explore the city some more. There weren&#8217;t any major sites that we had left to see, so we just decided to walk down any street that looked interesting. That turned out to be just about every street in Rome. We did find this quiet street for a nice hipster photo shoot.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-large" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233-e1433180549424-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="839" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233-e1433180549424-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233-e1433180549424-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233-e1433180549424-900x1200.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280233-e1433180549424-1280x1707.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">On our way back we stopped for drinks and bruschetta along the street. Out of no where a pack of Buddhist monks playing music strolled down the street handing out fliers.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-230" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280269-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Earlier that day I had seen a gelateria with a really long line outside, but it was empty when we passed it on the way back to the hotel. Apparently it has been rated one of the best in the city so we had to try it. We got two flavors, Honey and Fragola(strawberry). It didn’t come in a cone like other places, but it was still legit.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-231" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280275-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once it got dark out we went back to the Colosseum for some night pictures. On our way back we passed a square with a fountain that seemed to be the local hang out spot. There were people outside socializing, drinking beer, and dancing.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-232" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P5280288-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">I’ll leave you all with one last comment. Rome is an amazing city, but the trip will be somewhat marred by the pushy street peddlers, guides, and scammers. It’s definitely something you don’t read about when planning a trip, but it’s a sad reality. It’s literally all anyone talks about on YikYak in the area. Here were some of my favorite comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I want to beat someone trying to sell me a selfie stick with a selfie stick</p>
<p class="p1">To take down the selfie stick empire: infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier</p>
<p class="p1">If you see a forlorn peddler selling selfie sticks it’s probably because I just told him my arm is just as good</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Just know that if you visit Rome, expect to be heckled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On our first full day in Rome we decided to visit Vatican City, the smallest country in the world, for most of the day. We woke up early and stopped by a cafe on our way to the metro. Unlike in the U.S. where you can get eggs and toast , most Europeans choose coffee and a pastry. We decided to grab some croissants filled with chocolate/jam and I added on a cappuccino.<span id="more-199"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_212" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-212" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-768x1024.jpg" alt="Cappuccino and croissants for breakfast" width="629" height="839" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-900x1200.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1280x1707.jpg 1280w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Cappuccino and croissants for breakfast</p></div>
<p class="p1">When we arrived at the Vatican museum, we were immediately bombarded  by street guides trying to convince us to hire them. One told us that the line to get into the museum was 3 hours long and I believed it. The line must have been at least 500 people long, but luckily we had bought our tickets ahead of time and were able to skip the line. I had read that the Sistine Chapel can get packed early on so we decided to go there first even though it was towards the end of the walking tour. If I could describe it in one word I’d say it’s impressive, but that doesn’t do it justice. The ceiling is at least six stories high and makes you appreciate how someone could paint it without stepping back to get a perspective. Unfortunately they don&#8217;t allow you to take pictures. Shelley tried to be sneaky by using her front camera and pointed the screen to the ceiling, but the guards called her out.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we had enjoyed the Sistine Chapel we went back through the museum to view more of the art and wall carpets. In one of the courtyards there was a <em>Sphere Within Sphere </em>sculpture by Arnaldo Pomodor. I&#8217;m not sure why but these sculptures are my favorite. It&#8217;s probably because there are different renditions of it across the world. This one is now the third one I&#8217;ve seen in person outside of Dublin and Berkeley.</p>

<p class="p1">If there&#8217;s two things that Rome has a lot of it&#8217;s selfie sticks and basilicas. The biggest basilica in the world is at St Peter’s Square. Unfortunately, when we got there it was closed because the Pope had just held a papal audience. We took some pictures and decided we&#8217;d come back towards the end of the day to walk through it.</p>
<div id="attachment_201" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143-1024x768.jpg" alt="St. Peter's Square" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270143-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-201" class="wp-caption-text">St. Peter&#8217;s Square</p></div>
<p class="p1">We wandered around and stumbled upon a street lined with restaurants where we grabbed some sandwiches for lunch. We found some chairs along the street where we ate, enjoyed people watching and seeing peddlers try to sell knock off purses. After lunch we walked along the river up to the Piazza Popolo where we found one of the most photogenic street performer I&#8217;ve ever seen. At this point of the trip we had been harassed by street peddlers for selfie sticks but at this piazza they had a similar type of scam to the fake monks in San Francisco. Give a “free” flower to the girl, tie a friendship bracelet and then demand money in return. Luckily, they left us alone pretty quick.</p>

<p class="p1">We walked down the Via del Corso where you&#8217;ll find the high end stores like Gucci and Fendi. At the end of the side streets we found the Spanish Steps, but like most attractions in Rome, the Trinità dei Monti church was under construction. Nonetheless, the square and steps were a great place to sit, relax, and watch the crowd. There are even some guys selling beer and water, but we weren&#8217;t in the mood.</p>
<div id="attachment_203" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-203" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382-768x1024.jpg" alt="Sitting on the Spanish Steps" width="629" height="839" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382-900x1200.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5270183-e1433098148382-1280x1707.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-203" class="wp-caption-text">Sitting on the Spanish Steps</p></div>
<p class="p1">We picked up our pace back to our hotel because the sky was getting dark. We entered a tunnel and by the time we got to the other end it was pouring. Like magic, all the selfie stickies being sold instantly turned into umbrellas.</p>
<p class="p1">After resting for a bit the rain started to let up so we headed back to St Peter&#8217;s square to visit the basilica. I was worried we wouldn’t make it through the 100 person line in time since the basilica was going to close in an hour, but it moved pretty fast and we were inside within 30 minutes. I think the Romans coined the term “go big or go home” during the baroque era because everything they built during that time period is huge including St Peter&#8217;s Basilica. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words:</p>

<p class="p1">My friend, Charles “Cheese” Cossell, recommended we go to this restaurant called Dino &amp; Tony’s near Vatican City. He said it was the best italian food he had in all of Italy. They technically have a menu, but you’d be a fool to order from it. One of the brother’s recommends the entire meal for you and you really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to come out. Be ready to eat though, this is a legit italian dinner. Here&#8217;s what our meal looked like:</p>

<p class="p1">We tried to stop here because we were stuffed and knew we had contorno and insalata (yes they serve salad at the end of the meal) left, but our waiter insisted on dessert. It was tiramisu, Shelley&#8217;s favorite. We couldn&#8217;t pass it up and I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t. It was hands down the best tiramisu I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p class="p1">Overall, the food was amazing. My favorite dish was easily the first pasta dish. It was penne pasta cooked al dente with olive oil, pepper, parmesan cheese and pancetta. The service on the other hand was a bit lacking. However, I hadn’t really received great service anywhere in Italy yet. Everywhere we went people seemed annoyed to serve us. Nonetheless, it was still a great meal and experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">To celebrate the end of busy season, Shelley and I booked a two week trip to Europe. Our flight there was anything but convenient. We flew the red eye from San Francisco to Newark and had an eight hour layover. Luckily, my aunt and uncle live nearby so they offered to host us for a few hours. <span id="more-193"></span>It was definitely nice to be able to take a shower and get some home made eggs, bacon and toast for breakfast.  For lunch, we tried finding a sandwich shop but everything was closed for Memorial Day. In the end we settled for burgers at a local pub.</p>
<p class="p1">Our next leg was from Newark to Stockholm and then on to Rome. I had been a bit worried leading up to this trip because we had booked a separate flight on Norwegian from Stockholm to Rome and only had 2 hours to connect. That may sound like a lot, but we were flying United and you never know what kind of delays they may have. Not to mention, I wasn’t too sure about the immigration situation. Have you ever been to SFO? It could take at least an hour to get through the line there. We ended up arriving early, breezed through immigration and didn’t have to change terminals for our flight. So I pretty much worried for nothing.</p>
<p class="p1">Upon arriving in Rome we caught the express train to the city center where our hotel was only a 15 minute walk away. We couldn’t have asked for a better location. Our hotel was a short walk from most of the attractions we wanted to see and the metro was nearby. We dropped off our bags and grabbed some pizza and a thing that resembled a hot pocket for lunch.</p>
<p class="p1">Our first attraction was the Trevi Fountain. Unfortunately it’s undergoing restoration so there wasn’t much to really see. Next, we walked down the street to the Pantheon. It’s pretty impressive to think that the dome is self supporting.</p>
<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-194" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260002-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We continued down the side streets until we came to Piazza Navona and sat at one of the fountains where we enjoyed some street performers playing music.</p>
<div id="attachment_195" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-195" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-195" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021-1024x768.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260021-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-195" class="wp-caption-text">Street performers at Piazza Navona</p></div>
<p class="p1">We continued around the square and took a look at some art before heading down to Campo de Fiori. Unfortunately, the market had already been packed up and it was too early for any of the bars to be open, but we did encounter our first roman drinking fountain. They look pretty sketchy at first, but the water is the same that you get from the tap. There’s a makeshift way to make into a fountain if you cup your hand over the spout. The water was surprisingly cool considering how hot it was outside.</p>
<div id="attachment_196" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-196" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-196" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037-1024x768.jpg" alt="Roman drinking fountain" width="629" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037-900x675.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/P5260037-1280x960.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-196" class="wp-caption-text">Roman drinking fountain</p></div>
<p class="p1">We continued to wander around side streets and ended up near the river. We walked along it for a bit before we settled at a restaurant for drinks. Let me just say, if you drink anything other than wine you’re a fool. It’s so cheap.</p>
<p class="p1">We ended the night grabbing dinner at a restaurant near our place. It didn’t seem too authentic, but the ravioli and plate of prosciutto we got were delicious. We didn’t stay out too late considering we had jet lag and needed to get up early to visit the Vatican the following day.</p>
