					<description><![CDATA[Hey John,

All the best for your trip. Please ensure both of you keep atleast 2-3 days for Switzerland (not a night stay as you seem to have planned for now). 

As I am going to be re-sharing each update from you, few blog/social media requests to make this easier :)

1. Create a travel FB page that is 
1.1 Sync&#039;ed with your blog to ensure we receive updates in the FB newsfeed
1.2 Allows my friends and other interested folks to follow you (Blog by itself is difficult to follow and obviously they can&#039;t follow your fb profile as such)

2.  Travel Schedule: There are quite a few of us who may like to meet/host you along the way and so any tentative travel schedule would be great]]></description>
